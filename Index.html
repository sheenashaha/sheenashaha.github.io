        <h1>Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition</h1>
        <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Deep residual learning framework addresses the problem of training very deep neural networks by proposing a residual learning approach. This framework enables the training of networks with depths of over 100 layers. The paper demonstrates that residual networks achieve superior performance on image classification tasks compared to traditional networks.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Deep neural networks with many layers have shown remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks. However, training such deep networks poses significant challenges. The residual learning framework proposed in this paper introduces a novel architecture that helps in the effective training of very deep networks, facilitating improvements in accuracy and performance.</p>

        <h2>2. Methodology</h2>
        <p>The residual learning framework uses residual blocks to learn the residuals of the desired mapping. The residual block is defined by a shortcut connection that bypasses one or more layers, allowing the network to learn the residuals more efficiently. The architecture includes several residual blocks stacked together to form a deep network.</p>

        <h2>3. Results</h2>
        <p>The experiments conducted demonstrate that residual networks outperform traditional convolutional networks in terms of accuracy on benchmark datasets such as ImageNet. Residual networks with over 100 layers achieve state-of-the-art performance, showing significant improvements over previous methods.</p>

        <h2>4. Discussion</h2>
        <p>The results indicate that the residual learning approach significantly alleviates the vanishing gradient problem and facilitates the training of very deep networks. The paper discusses the implications of this approach on future network architectures and its potential impact on other computer vision tasks.</p>

        <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Residual learning provides a robust solution for training very deep neural networks, leading to improved performance on various benchmarks. The proposed architecture has set new records in image classification tasks and opens up new possibilities for future research in deep learning.</p>
